					<h1> General Information </h1>
                    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Tiffany Chai. I'm currently a sophomore at the George Washington University majoring in Accounting and minoring in Computer Science. Although a lot of my time goes to my academics, I'm really involved with my sorority, Sigma Psi Zeta, on campus. Joining this sorority made me much more confident in myself and as well, allowed me to gain not only friends, but sisters.</p>
                    <p>I was born and raised in the D.C. metropolitan area (Mongtogomery County to be more specific), so I know a lot of places to go to around D.C. I'm also super picky about my food and drinks, but every restaurant/cafe I go to and love, lots of people will love as well.</p>
                    <h1> Hobbies </h1>
					<p>There are so many things I love to do. Number one, EATING! Cause, what's life without food?</p>
					<p>Number two, singing! I've been singing since I've been a little girl. Opera, Pop, Jpop, Kpop, Classical, I can sing it all! As long as I like the song of course.</p>
					<p>Number three, playing League of Legends. Well, this is a new hobby. I blame my friend for downloading it on my computer. It's a great way to destress. Add me if you play! Username: cantabile86 </p>
					<p>Number four, cooking and baking! Although I'm super bad at cooking (I set off the smoke detector in my dorm before LOL), I love cooking and baking! I love to bake anything that has to do with chocolate (truffles, chocolate cake, you name it!). </p>
				</div>
				<h1> What I like </h1>
					<p> Should I mention food again? But yah, food is up there.</p>
					<p> When it comes to music, I love listening to taiwanese music (tpop?), kpop, jpop, opera, classical, pop, ballads, and I think that's about it. I've been listening to a lot of asian music these days (especially AKB48, SISTAR, AOA, GFriend, and B.A.P.), but nothing can replace my Phantom of the Opera! </p>
					<p> I don't really watch T.V. shows, but I do try to keep up with Blind Spot. I do sometimes watch anime, but it's tiring compared to reading manga. I like watching Running Man if I have time. </p>
