                   <p>Looking for a good hairdresser is very tiring in D.C. It's all about trial and error. But, even though that's true, if you just follow my recommendations, you will be fine! As well, what about nail salons? Which ones are good? Well, just keep scrolling, and you'll figure it out!</p>

				<p>Kamiya-A is a hair salon owned by Akiko. Akiko has over 10 years of experience with hair. When my sister recommended me to her to get my hair dyed (first time ever), I was rather skeptical, but I set up an appointment anyways.</p>
				<p>Getting an appointment with Akiko is hard. I set my appointment 2 months before my actual appointment (but maybe that's because I was dying my hair).</p>
				<p>Kamiya-A is located near the intersection between U street and 17th Street. I took a lyft there (cause it was wayyyyy to cold to walk). I was rather confused where the salon was (cause it's quite hidden). But, once I found it, I walked into a salon that had a nice, homey feel to it. </p>
				<p>Akiko decorated her salon with everything she loves, which is mostly Miyazaki items and Gundam items. As well, everything she has (the chairs, the mirrors) she brought back from Japan.</p>
				<p>She's super nice, and great to talk to. Her dog is also adorable (he put his head on my lap while I was still getting my hair dyed).</p>
				<p>My hair dye came out super nice! And my hair wasn't dry like most of my friends' dyed hair!</p>
				<p>Although she's a bit expensive, I would definetly go there again to get my hair done!</p>
