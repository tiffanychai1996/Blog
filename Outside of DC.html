					<p>Over this summer, my sister and I traveled to Europe and Asia for fun. My sister picked the places, I just went along with it. Our first stop, Keflavik, Iceland!</p>
					<p>My sister book tickets on WOW air (a low cost airline that finally created a flight from D.C. to Iceland). All the seats were economy class (and you could only bring up to 11 lbs as carry on/luggage if you don't want to pay extra). The seats were surprisingly comfortable (unlike United Airlines' seats-very uncomfy).</p>
					<p>Once we landed in Reykjavik airport, we got on the bus that took us to Keflavik. Now, it's time for sightseeing/food.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
					<h1>Hallgrimskirkja</h1>
					<p>First stop, Hallgrimskirkja (don't think I can even pronounce it). Hallgrimskirkja is a church, and is the tallest building in Iceland (if you look on the pictures, it's the third picture).</p>
					<p>Being the tallest building, of course there would be a way to stand near the top to have a view of Rekjavik. You have to pay to go up (but when I went, no one really enforced it). Once you pay, you go onto this small elevator that would bring you up.</p>
					<p>Once you're up there, you get a very nice view of the city.</P>
					<p>If you get tired of looking at the city, you can go down and look at the church itself.</p>
					<h1>Cafes</h1>
					<p>There are literally so many cafes in the city. Like, every block. But, it's great because we were able to have so much caffeine in our system for the rest of the day.</p>
					<h1>Blue Lagoon</h1>
					<p>Blue Lagoon isn't really in the city, but it's definitely something you should go to! You have to take a bus to get to the Blue Lagoon.</p>
					<p>What exactly is this place? Well, Blue Lagoon is an outdoor, natural, hot spring. To get into the Blue Lagoon, it costs 35 euros. But, it's better if you upgrade to comfort. It only costs 15 euros more. It will gie you not only the visitor pass into the Blue Lagoon, but also a towel, one free drink, and a skin care trial pack.</p>
					<p>Be careful of putting your hair in the hot spring! Cause, it will dry out and become really tangled.</p>
					<h1>BÃ¦jarins Beztu Pylsur</h1>
					<p>If you have time, stop by this hot dog stand in Iceland! It's a great place to eat at and it's really popular. The hotdog has a nice bite to it and you won't regret getting one!</p>
